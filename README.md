# ü§ñ Hola, soy @Emmanuel-RH. 
I'm a passionate student of Information Technology at the University of Veracruz and I love sharing my school programming projects on this repository. Through my projects, I strive to enhance my programming skills and knowledge, as well as put into practice what I learn in the classroom.  

My main goal is to learn something new every day in the field of computer science, whether it's through research, experimentation, or teamwork. I'm motivated by the constant challenge that this discipline entails and by the possibility of creating innovative technological solutions. In addition to my passion for programming, I'm also interested in staying up-to-date with the latest trends and advances in the world of technology, which allows me to be prepared to face the challenges that may arise in the future.
